What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- It creates the .git directory with the metadata needed
- It's needed because in that way we can start to tracking changes along the files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

 - It's different from WD because it allows you to separate 
 the changes you are sure you want to commit 
 - Offers the value to leave the work where you are and continue later
