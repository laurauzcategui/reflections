When working with GIT we have

- Working directory
- Staging area
- Repository

If you accidentally add a file to the staging area, you can remove it using git reset. For example, if you accidentally add lesson_2_reflections.txt, but donâ€™t want it to be committed yet, run git reset lesson_2_reflections.txt

git init operates on repository
git add operates on staging area
git status operates on staging area & working directory

df035382c41b4d0cda86a1aa30b53f15bef05b53 old
25ede836903881848fea811df5b687b59d962da3 new

this.delayBeforeBullet = 10;

git diff show any changes between working directory and staging area
git diff --staged display differences between staging and repository

git reset --hard discard any changes
if run this without staging you lost changes

Branches
--Master is the main branch for the repository

-If i want to create a branch :
  git branch [name]
- If i want to switch between branches
  git checkout [name of the branch]

  allows to compare the branches

  git log --graph --oneline master coins

  reachability : one commit cannot be reached for other commits
  one commit is not reacheable when you dont checkout from branch.

  If you checkout from commit id and commit over it you might lose your changes
  If you dont want to lose it you  could create a new branch by :

  git checkout -b [new_branch_name]


Git merge

 git merge branch_1 branch_2

 it should merge one branch into another (branch2 into branch1)
