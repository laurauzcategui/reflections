#lesson 3 reflections

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When you are working in many computers
- When you are working with another members of the team

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Because sometimes I would like to finish some changes first
